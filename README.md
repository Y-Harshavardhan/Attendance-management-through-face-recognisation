# Attendance-management-through-face-recognisation
Attendance Management System using Face Recognition

📌 Overview

This project is an Attendance Management System that uses Face Recognition to mark student attendance automatically. It utilizes OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and Tkinter for GUI-based implementation.

🚀 Features

Face Detection & Recognition using OpenCV

Automatic Attendance Logging

GUI Interface using Tkinter

CSV-Based Attendance Reports

Real-Time Camera Capture for Authentication

Data Storage & Management

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV (for image processing)

NumPy (for numerical operations)

TensorFlow/PyTorch (for deep learning-based face recognition)

Tkinter (for graphical user interface)

Pandas (for data handling and storage)

📥 Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.7+ recommended). You also need to install the required libraries:

pip install opencv-python numpy pandas pillow tensorflow torch torchvision tkinter

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Y-Harshavardhan/Attendance-management-through-face-recognisation.git
cd Attendance-management-through-face-recognisation

🔧 Usage

Run the Application

python main.py

Register Faces: The system will allow users to register their faces in the database.

Start Attendance: Use the camera to scan faces and automatically mark attendance.

Export Attendance Reports: Data is saved in a CSV file for easy access.

📊 Data Storage

Face embeddings are stored for recognition.

Attendance records are saved in CSV format.
